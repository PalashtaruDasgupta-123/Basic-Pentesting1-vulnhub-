						                                        	INTRODUCTION

Hello Guys today i am gonna explain you how to successfully crack the password of pentesting1 box.This box is for the basic pentester
who can pentest the box easily. acctualy i am also new in this field, this box is very easy, so lets starts.......

					                                        		Explanetion


This box is basically based on linux platform and its OS is ubuntu, so you need to crack the Login password and its username is 
'merlinspike'.this is a OVA file so you need to Virtual Box to open it, so now fireup your kali machine and also fire up your 
basic pentesting1 box. now fireup your terminal and start your netdiscover tool to reveal the IP Address of the Target Machine.
After successfully scan you got your IP Address, in my case my ip was 192.168.0.206 this is the ip of target machine. After then
open nmap and try this command for version scan 'nmap -sV <targetIP>, after scanning you got three ports are open. First
port no 21 who support the service of FTP and Version is proftpd 1.3.3c, second port no is 22 SSH running on this port and third is port no 80
which support HTTP.Port 22 is nothing interesting here, but port 80 and version of FTP is very special, so you first start nikto 
and command is nikto -h then type <targetIP>, so here you might be noticed that one interesting Directory is here name 'SECRET'.
Check the directory but nothing special here.Now come to the point port no 21 is support version proftpd1.3.3c, so main thing is here
open your msfconsole or metasploit and search proftpd1.3.3c now you get one backdoor exploit here,(exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor)
type use 'exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor' and your payload is 'cmd/unix/reverse' now fullfill your requirements and start run or exploit.
Now you got the root access of target machine.

                                             Now with the python you need to spawn for access the shell and your command is
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' after shell access you have to type 'ls' command then go to the the shadow file 
type command 'cat /etc/shadow and i got one hash file which is marlinspike:$6$wQb5nV3T$xB2WO/jOkbn4t1RUILrckw69LR/0EMtUbFFCYpM3MUHVmtyYW9.ov/aszTpWhLaC2x6Fvy5tpUUxQbUhCKbl4/:17484:0:99999:7:::
ok now you got the hash file and store it in the text file(you can use leafpad in kali to store a text file).Now use john the ripper
for crack the password!!!!!!!!!

					                                        		Conclusion


Overall this is a very easy box, but as a bigginer i face littile bit tuff moment, but i complete this task successfully,
so guys thats it. Hope yo guys enjoy with this box.
