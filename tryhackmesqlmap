       						                                   Explanetion

Sqlmap is opensource penetration testing tool, with this tool we are hack the sqlmap box in tryhackme.fireup your favourite tool
gobuster and scan the interesting directory,the syntax is gobuster dir -u http://10.10.53.36/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists
/directory-list-2.3-small.txt so now you run the command and get one interesting directory '/blood'. But here you see the vulnerable
url that is http://10.10.53.36/blood/view.php?id=1, start sqlmap and type sqlmap -u http://10.10.53.36/blood/view.php?id=1
--batch --dbs. Afterthen you will get your database blood,now in database u need to find tables,command is sqlmap -u http://10.10.53.36/blood/view.php?id=1
--batch -D blood --tables,after getting tables you need to get coloumns then dump all the data from database.So i hope you get your flag and current user which is root
and your flag is thm{sqlm@p_is_L0ve}.
